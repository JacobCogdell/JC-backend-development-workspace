# My name is Jacob Cogdell and the purpose of this repository is for my backend development class I am taking this semester. This will be my workspace where I complete many different assignments throughout the semester. 

# A backend development workspace is where I write and test the server-side code that handles data, logic, and APIs behind an application. It usually includes a code editor, a database, and tools for testing and version control so everything runs smoothly before it goes live.

# Understand how the backend of an application works
Store, manage, and retrieve data from a database
Build APIs that let the frontend talk to the server
Add user login, permissions, and basic security
Deploy and keep backend applications running smoothly

# I’ll use my GitHub repository to keep all my backend projects in one place and track my progress as I learn. It also gives me a way to share my work, get feedback, and show what I can build.
